# sum-all-numbers

This project contains a function sumAll that takes an array of two numbers and returns the sum of every number between them (inclusive).

-The two numbers may not always be in order, so the function uses Math.min and Math.max to handle both cases.

-A for loop adds all numbers in the range.
